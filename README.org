* Ray Tracing In One Weekend - Nim edition

A quick and dirty version of [[https://raytracing.github.io/][Ray Tracing in One Weekend]], using Nim.

I went through the book to better understand some concepts
(essentially how to structure code) in ray tracing and not to
write the nicest code. For a prettier Nim implementation take a look
at @mratsim's [[https://github.com/mratsim/trace-of-radiance][trace of radiance]].

The final output of my code (final book 1 result):
